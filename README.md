# The GripNet Architecture
GripNet is an effective and efficient framework to learn node representations on **heterogeneous graphs** (or Knowledge Graphs) for multi-relational **link prediction**, and **node classification**, when there is only a type of node/edge related to the task. It is also a natural framework for graph-like **data integration** (i.e. integrating multiple datasets). GripNet overcomes the limitations of meta-path and message-passing based methods, and improves their prediction accuracy. In additional, by reducing unnecessary expensive graph convolution operations, GripNet improves the time and space efficiency of GCN based methods. See details on the algorithm in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15914).
